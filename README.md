## How to deploy this app to Hugging Face Spaces

1. Go to <https://huggingface.co/spaces/giswqs/voila-geospatial/tree/main> and duplicate the space to your own space.

2. Set environment variables as need. For example, if you use Google Earth Engine, you need to set `EARTHENGINE_TOKEN` to your Earth Engine token. The token value should be copied from the following file depending on your operating system:

   ```text
   Windows: C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.config\\earthengine\\credentials
   Linux: /home/USERNAME/.config/earthengine/credentials
   MacOS: /Users/USERNAME/.config/earthengine/credentials
   ```

   Simply open the file and copy **ALL** the content to the `EARTHENGINE_TOKEN` environment variable.

3. After the space is built successfully, click the `Embed this Space` menu and find the `Direct URL` for the app, such as <https://giswqs-voila-geospatial.hf.space>.

4. Add your own notebooks to the `notebooks` folder and wait for the app to be rebuilt.

5. To hide the source code from the notebook, modify `run.sh` and set `--strip_sources=True`.
